          Why Shortly?

        <p className="text-gray-300 mb-2">
          When faced with long URLs, research has shown that most internet users
          initially believe the link is spam, so it is easy to see why short
          URLs appeal to those who want to drive traffic to their site. Your URL
          is the very first impression your website will make, yet it is
          something people often overlook.
        </p>
        <p className="flex gap-2 text-gray-300 ">
          <MdOutlineEmojiEmotions className="text-6xl text-green-500" />
          People have a natural tendency to associate a shorter URL with a more
          reputable site. When seeing a long string of characters and letters,
          users may feel apprehensive about the website. Though many legitimate
          sites have long URLs users still associate legitimacy with a shortened
          URL.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-300 mb-2">
          Shortened URLs are easier to remember, making advertising or
          distribution more effective. A shortened URL makes it easier to copy
          from a print source, or anytime you may have to type in a link instead
          of clicking. A shortened URL has a higher chance of becoming a
          permalink. (A permalink is an URL that is intended to not change in
          the future).
          {isInView1 ? "" : <ReadMoreButton onClick={toggleViewMore1} />}

          <>
            <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
              Shortened URLs are more aesthetically pleasing. Shortening a URL
              lets you mask unnecessary information. Twitter and some other
              services limit character length, so a shortened URL makes it
              easier to share across any platform. In-depth research analysis
              shows that shorter URLs are shared more frequently, compared to
              comparable sites or pages with long URLs.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-300 mb-2">
              The process of redirection behind URL shortening can be
              complicated. Use a trusted source like ShortLy to avoid
              complications. Some URL shorteners provide very limited custom
              domains, and others will not work with your domain. The free
              service at Shortly delivers a quick, easy and free way to generate
              a shorter URL for your site. The process for URL shortening is
              reliable and secure, so you can safely generate a better URL.

        <p className="text-gray-300 mb-2">
          Your URL is the first step toward improving search engine optimization
          (SEO).
        </p>
        <p className="flex gap-2 text-gray-300 ">
          Bots have a difficult time with long and complicated URLs so it makes
          sense that shorter URLs will receive a higher ranking. Short URLs help
          your site to establish trust and authority.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-300 mb-2">
          As your business or online presence grows, so will your website.
          Growing your site will be much more comfortable with a shortened URL.
          As you add more pages of content, a shortened URL makes it easier to
          link each subsequent page without creating an unnecessarily long URL.

          <>
            <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
              A shortened URL also conveys professionalism. Deciding which link
              we are going to click from an internet search result,
              advertisement, or social media share is something that happens
              almost subliminally. We want links that convey where they will
              take us, and our brains register shortened links as more
              professional.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-300 mb-2">
              Using a URL shortener is one of the quickest and easiest things
              you can do to increase traffic and click-throughs to your site.
              When used in conjunction with smart SEO choices, relevant
              information on your website and analytics-driven marketing, you
              will be well on your way to establishing an online presence for
              your business, service or blog. Most people without in-depth
              knowledge of SEO and web technology think they need to pay a
              fortune for a reputable webmaster. In truth, there are many ways
              to create an attractive, well-ranked and respectable website. URL
              shortners, like Shortly, are one more tool in your box to help you
              build the website you need.
